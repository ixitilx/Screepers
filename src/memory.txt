VM maintains state of global variables for prolonged periods of time.

Although it is possible for Screeps to reset VM - it is beneficial to keep intermediate values cached

Basically, flow is as follows (for each tick):
- if object does not exist - create
- - if memory for this object exist - load
- operate on object
- dump object state back to memory

It's crucial to limit memory interop to initialize/dump methods and operate  objects only via their defined interface

Therefore - interface is as follows:
getController(gameObject) {
	if(cached) {
		cached[gameObject.id].updateGameObject(gameObject)
		return cached[gameObject.id]
	}
}
